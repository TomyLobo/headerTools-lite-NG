      <h1>Successfully installed {addon} </h1>
        <p>Thank you for installing {addon}. You are now running <b>{addon} {version}</b> on Thunderbird {appver}.</p>
        
    
    
 
        <h2>Allows to modify the header and the source of messages</h2>

       <div>
        <p>This is an update of Header Tools Lite by Paolo Kaosmos to TB 78 and 91. 
       <br> No functionality has been added or removed. As in the original version (tested in TB 60), editing headers may loose flags (read, star) or 
       tags/keywords. If this should be important to you, you are invited to support an adaptation by a donation.</p>
        
        <h3>This extension allows the user to change (edit) messages in any folder.</h3>
        
          <p>   The editing features (changing the headers only or the entire source of a message) are accessible from the menu "Message" -> "HeaderToolsLite" or from the context menu in the message panel.<br>
        
        The edit source function should be used with caution, because an error could cause problems in displaying all messages in a folder. Moreover, it might  not work properly with some characters and some encodings.
      </p>
        
      <ul>  Options for the extension:
        
     <li> Put the original message to the Trash (default = true): the changes are made by creating a copy of the original message. This option controls whether the original message goes to the Trash folder, or is deleted.</li>
        
      <li> Forcing changes with IMAP accounts (default = true): some IMAP servers, such as Gmail, do not accept changes if some basic headers (date, sender, the message id, object) are not modified . With this option enabled, the changes are forced by changing the date of the message by 1 second.</li>
        
        <li> Add the header X-HeaderToolsLite (default = false): by enabling this option, every change (edit) adds a header that describes the type of change and its time and date.</li>
        
          <li> Set the maximum number of characters initially displayed when editing the full source (default = 150000).</li>
        
      </ul>

            In TB 78/91, Thunderbird internals changed widely. Klaus Buecher/opto has been working to make {addon} fully 
            functional again for Thunderbird 91. At lot of personal time has been put into this. I appreciate if you can support
          this work by a donation. </p>
